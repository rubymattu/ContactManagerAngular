Test adding a contact with empty data. *** Done *** No record added, simply stays on the Add Contact Page

Test adding a duplicate contact. *** Done *** duplicate of contact was added. Image was not duplicated in the uploads folder on the backend which is good. Adding the duplicate will need to be corrected. When deleting the duplicate contact the image was deleted from the uploads folder. *** Action Item: do not allow duplicate emails and do not allow duplicate images. We also want to prevent duplicate emails and images when we update a contact. *** Testing suggested changes reveals that a duplicate email and a non duplicate imageName results in no contact added which is great but it uploads image which itshould not. Further suggestion to not upload immediately resulted in desired behavior for Add Contact. After suggested changes to prevent the use of either a duplicate email address or a duplicate image during the update process it works as expected. There is an issue with the Cancel which is identified elsewhere as an Action Item and will be addressed when tending to this later Actipn Item.
